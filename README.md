# ToDo List client

A client-side piece for for running my ToDo list project.
This is my very first project using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
I've been investigating also how to make it look nice, and I got into some nice packages like [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) to help me build some cool stuff.

### Prerequisites

For running this project is neccesary to have installed Node > 8. [Here you can find it](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installing

First of all, install Node modules.
```
cd todo-list-client
npm install
```

Now, start the application.
```
npm start
```

Browse http://localhost:3000 and check app is up and running.
